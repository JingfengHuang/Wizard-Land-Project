                            Have you tried to challenge the maze? In the magical world, the maze is no longer ordinary, unchanged. Illusory maze, a maze built with spells. Step by step, you need collective wisdom to work together to achieve success.

                            The levels of the maze are illusions generated by spells, which are constantly changing as the game progresses. Players need to adjust their strategy in real-time, otherwise, it will lead to failure.
